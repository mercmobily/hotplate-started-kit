# HOTPLATE STARTER KIT

This package is all you need to have a fully configured, fully functional node application based on [Hotplate](https://github.com/mercmobily/hotplate).

It includes:

* Example server with all you need to get started straight away
* Handy environment variables which depend on which branch you are on (`master` means `development`, `production` means `production`)
* Example stores already defined within a `main.js` file
* Ready to accept login via Facebook and username/password pair
* Password recovery URL/page already implemented
